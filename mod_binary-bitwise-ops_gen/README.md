# README.md

Note:

- I think I should restructure my mod_binary-bitwise-ops_gen, because what I'm currently doing in there is called bitmasking (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c/c-bitmasking/)
  - I should maybe make seperate modules for (basic) bitwise operations bit shifting (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp/left-shift-right-shift-operators-c-cpp/), bitmasking, etc.
